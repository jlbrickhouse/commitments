ak, a particle of frequent occurrence* in the Choctaw language. It is found, together with its compounds, in some form after nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs. The sense of this particle varies according to the part of speech it succeeds. It is sometimes ak, then hak or yak (perhaps kak should be added, from k, definite, and ak). It follows verbs. It is used as an article and a relative pronoun. It is a word often used for designation or distinction, not only of a thing, i. e., a noun, but also of action and herein it differs from the English, except when we render the verb as a noun. In akoke, Matt. 2: 6, it is distinctive and marks one object from all others.

hashi, n., a moon; a lunar month; a month, Josh. 4: 19; 5: 10.[Mr. Byington says of the Choctaw months: "But very few Choctaws know all the names or know when the months come in or go out." At first he inserted a list of month names in alphabetical order without stating whether they were obtained from one person or from several. Later he obtained and recorded two others, one October 23, 1854, from Ilapintabi, and the other December 31, 1856, from lyapali. Ilapintabi told him that the year began in the latter part of September, while, according to lyapali, it was in the latter part of March. Both of these statements are reconciled by a subsequent note to the effect that the year w r as divided into two series of six months each, a summer series and a winter series. From the time when these are said to have begun, September 21 and March 21, it is evident that the autumnal and vernal equinoxes were taken as starting points. The list of months obtained from lyapali is in almost complete agreement w r ith the earliest list recorded by Byington, and therefore is probably more correct than that of Ilapintabi. It is as follows:March- April, chafo chito (from hohchqfo chito, "big famine") April-May, hash koi n chush. May-June, liash koichito. June-July, hash mall. July-August, hash watullak.August-September, tek i n 1iqshi. September-October, Jnisli bUii. October-November, hash bissa. November-December, hash leaf. December-January, hash takkon.January-February, hash Jiopoui.February-March, diajiskono (from hoJicJiqfo iskiti-ni, "little famine"). Besides some inconsequential differences the earliest list has hasJt tratonlttk instead of fiqsli, watullak. No May-June month occurs in this list unless it is represented by "fuak uiosJioli," the specific-application of which is not given, and which appears to have been questioned by Mr. Byington s later informants. Since, however, a year of twelve strictly lunar months must be corrected at intervals to agree with the solar year, the editor suggests that luak mosholi, which means "fire extinguished," may have applied to an intercalary month or period at the time of the annual festival when the year began anew. Ilapintabi s list differs from that given only in inverting hash kofochush and hash koicltito, and hash mail and hash watullak, the first being made to fall in May-June, the second in April-May, the third in July-August, and the fourth in June-July.

As the art. an- is written a n , han, and /, so this has three ways, o, /&lt;o, i/o 11 , and chiefly for the sake of euphony, yet Ion usually follows a verb, yo n a noun, and o n a word which ends with a consonant, as icak o n , liatak o n .
